# How To Set Credit Limit ?

My colleagues argued an issue how to set credit limit for new applicants for consumption loan.

Which one will be a right proposal? Setting up a credit limit on down-top direction or top-down direction ?

Top-down strategy means, give new applicant a total amount based on credit score, then allocate total amount into several loan lines.

Down-top strategy means, give each loan line an independent credit limit based on credit score, then sum up these credit limits as the total amount of the applicant.

If just taking a consideration in terms of computation, I think that both of proposals can be available.

The project will be discussing around the Credit Limit Setting. Maybe touch some topics about goal programming.

Let's start. It could not be a big project. hu..hu..hu
